Compilation:
-------------
* This prgram uses Boost Gregorian headers and library for compilation and execution.
  More specifically it uses the cygboost_date_time.dll library.
* Certain parts of the code uses C++11 language standards, so if your compiler needs
  a special flag to insruct it so, you need to do that when compiling the program (for
  example: in g++, you need to use the option -std=c++11)


Installation on Windows:
------------------------
* You need to ensure that the cygboost_date_time.dll also exists in the same folder
  as that of the executable or in any folder determined by the %PATH% environment
  variable.


Running the program:
---------------------
The program will take the following as input (not necessarily in the order 
mentioned below):
 1) service guide file
 2) service history file
 3) current odometer reading
 4) prediction of service in kms
 5) output file name
 6) purchase date

The program will create the following output:
one file with parts needed for servicing with service instruction
